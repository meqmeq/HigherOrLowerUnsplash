# HigherOrLowerUnsplash

This is just going to be small project Potentially for my CS50x

I'm going to be using MERN stack. In hope to seeing if I learned anything in the first 2 Parts of the open courseware FullStackOpen.

I'll be using the unsplash API that compares two images and the user will interact by choosing which one is higher or lower
